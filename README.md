In this project, I built a predictive model to identify patients likely to miss medical appointments using the LightGBM classifier. The dataset was preprocessed with categorical encoding and split into training and test sets. Initially, the baseline model performed well in terms of accuracy but struggled with recall due to class imbalance. To address this, I incorporated balanced class weights and fine-tuned hyperparameters using Optuna, an automated optimization framework.

1- Key improvements after hyperparameter tuning:

2- Increased Recall: More effectively identified no-show cases

3- Higher ROC AUC Score: Improved model's ability to distinguish between show and no-show cases

Optimized LightGBM Parameters: Enhanced model efficiency and performance

This project demonstrates my expertise in data preprocessing, machine learning model optimization, and handling class imbalance to improve predictive accuracy in real-world applications.
